***************************************************************************************************************
This is a MOD for 7 Days To Die Alpha 18.

It removes all the Basic Survival Quests in a way where you still get the 4 Skill Points and the Trader Marker.

Just load into the game and in a few seconds you should get your 4 Points and the trader marker.

<HOW TO>
Simply place the unzipped file into your 7 Days To Die/Mods Folder.
EG, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods"

The file it should look like this,
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\Jessica's No Starter Quests\Config\quests.xml
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\Jessica's No Starter Quests\Modinfo.xml
